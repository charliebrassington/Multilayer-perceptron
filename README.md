# Multilayer-perceptron
- Raw implementation of a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) using no libraries

## Features
- Supports the activation function sigmoid for now
- Supports forward propagation

## Still needs adding
- Supervised learning implementing back propagation
- Support for relu and softmax
- Support for optimization
- Examples of how to use the raw MLP
